# Best Grass 
### 문제 

Bessie is planning her day of munching tender spring grass and is gazing out upon the pasture which Farmer John has so lovingly partitioned into a grid with R (1 <= R <= 100) rows and C (1 <= C <= 100) columns. She wishes to count the number of grass clumps in the pasture.

Each grass clump is shown on a map as either a single '#' symbol or perhaps two '#' symbols side-by-side (but not on a diagonal). No two symbols representing two different clumps are adjacent. Given a map of the pasture, tell Bessie how many grass clumps there are.

By way of example, consider this pasture map where R=5 and C=6:

~~~
.#....
..#...
..#..#
...##.
.#....
~~~

This pasture has a total of 5 clumps: one on the first row, one that spans the second and third row in column 2, one by itself on the third row, one that spans columns 4 and 5 in row 4, and one more in row 5.
